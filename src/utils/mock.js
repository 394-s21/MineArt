export const leftPrompt="First Impression: COLORS! Why does it look kind of bleak?"
export const leftExplanation="Most of the painting is made up of dull oranges, blues, and greens, which form the backdrop for the boats and the sunrise. The sun and the reflection really JUMPS OUT from the rest of the dull tones."
export const leftAction="Try changing its colors to give it a new look."

export const centerPrompt="Now a Closer Look: BRUSH! Why does it look hastily painted?"
export const centerExplanation="Monet’s aim was not to create an accurate landscape but to record the impressions formed while looking at it. Critic Leroy used “impressionism” to mock it, but the term was later adopted as the term of the movement."
